# Opening

My name is Zihao, a student from Tongji Univeristy, Shanghai.

I am both a Most Valuable Profession(MVP) and Microsoft Student Ambassador(MSA) in China.

I have a video channel about AI, Python, Machine Learning, Deep learning, Computer Vision and raspberry pi. Also have many tutorials of Azure and Cognitive Service.

In this special period of time, thanks for giving me this precious opportunity.

I am looking forward to sharing my experience about technology content creation and open source community.

# My cool personal story

## `How you changed you career from a civil engineer to a developer?`

(hate coding, never code)

## `How I met Microsoft?`

(upenn, CEO, blockchain, github)

Microsoft student club in Tongji University

summer camp of MSRA

intern in MSRA

## `MVP and MSA`

All kinds of experts and open source advocators.

- Raspberry Pi hardware basic(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ab411x7aC) 
- Simple tutorials of Microsoft cognitive service(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CE411e7XR)

has gained great reputation in AI community.

# My intuition and idea

We aim to help zero basic beginners quickly master AI and big data with easy to understand and interesting vernacular, and quickly apply what they have learned

To provide a complete system of AI education solutions for students, job seekers, employees and large enterprises in the field of artificial intelligence and data analysis. Help beginners to cross the threshold of mathematics foundation, algorithm programming, frontier exploration and application landing, and quickly apply what they have learned.

From simple dormitory recording and broadcasting to professional recording studio, from fighting alone to professional post production team, from small workshop production to large factory invitation and cooperation. 

Four crucial fundations of an AI developer:

- Math(linear algebra, probability statistics)
- Coding and programming(python,scikit-learn,keras)
- Algorithm
- Real project(get your hands dirty)

This process is extremely enjoyable for the team. It is determined from the bottom of my heart that we are doing a great thing and providing high-quality educational resources for a huge number of future learners. No matter from national policies, public science popularization, making money, media brands, knowledge creation, it will create huge long-term value.

## Open Source Project Wuhan 2020

Open source community and technology will thoroughly reshape the form of cooperation and knowledge production in the future, and consequently change everyone's life.

Especially in China, open source became more and more popular,  developers use Github.

Not only do they use open source developing toolkit such as visual studio code.

But also contribute their power to community. 

For instance.

At the early age of the covid-19 pandemic, middle January of 2020. Precisely the second day Wuhan this city was locked down.

My phd mentor Wang Wei and my friend Zhao Shengyu, they set up a open source project called Wuhan2020. They put their white paper and code on Github.

This project gather different information about hospital, hotel, factory, donation as well as mask and medical resource. Hundreds of volunteers took part in this project and built 23 repositories on Github.

Arrange those precious resource with high efficiency and transparent.

# Hero speech at last

The world is rapidly changing, 

Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic, 

After a year of hardship, we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

Not only the community of open-source or technology developers.

But also the community of common destiny for all mankind.
