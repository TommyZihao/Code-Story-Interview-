# My intuition and idea

We aim to help zero basic beginners quickly master AI and big data with easy to understand and interesting vernacular, and quickly apply what they have learned

To provide a complete system of AI education solutions for students, job seekers, employees and large enterprises in the field of artificial intelligence and data analysis. Help beginners to cross the threshold of mathematics foundation, algorithm programming, frontier exploration and application landing, and quickly apply what they have learned.

From simple dormitory recording and broadcasting to professional recording studio, from fighting alone to professional post production team, from small workshop production to large factory invitation and cooperation. 

Four crucial fundations of an AI developer:

- Math(linear algebra, probability statistics)
- Coding and programming(python,scikit-learn,keras)
- Algorithm
- Real project(get your hands dirty)

# What can we do to face the challenge in the future?

Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic,

We are not alone on the Great Way and the whole world is one family. After a year of hardship, we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

This process is extremely enjoyable for the team. It is determined from the bottom of my heart that we are doing a great thing and providing high-quality educational resources for a huge number of future learners. No matter from national policies, public science popularization, making money, media brands, knowledge creation, it will create huge long-term value. To build community of common destiny for all mankind.
