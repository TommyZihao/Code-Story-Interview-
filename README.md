# Opening

## `Tell us about your self, please`

My name is Zihao, a student from Tongji Univeristy, Shanghai.

I am both a Most Valuable Professional(MVP) and Microsoft Student Ambassador(MSA) in China.

I am also a student leader in Microsoft Student Club in Tongji University.

And I was an intern in MSRA.

I have a video channel about AI, Python, Machine Learning, Deep learning, Computer Vision and raspberry pi. Also have many tutorials of Azure and Cognitive Service such as Custom Vision.

In this special period of time, thanks for giving me this precious opportunity.

I am looking forward to sharing my experience about technology content creation and open source community.

# My cool personal story

## `How you changed you career from a civil engineer to a developer?`

That's a really interesting story.

I majored in civil engineering when I was an undergraduate.

To be honest, at that time, I hate coding, I never write a single line of code.

I thought coding is exhausting, especially debugging is something hard and boring.

My major, civil engineering, focus on all kinds of construction, design and build architecture,  house, tunnel, bridge, railway, tower, nothing but mechanics and dynamics.

There have already been lots of ready-made technical standards or software, you just follow the rules and nothing special, nothing new.

This is my graduation project, I spent 3 months designing an office building. 



The thing changed in 2018 when I was an exchange student at the University of Pennsylvania,

There was a lecture in Wharton school, inviting CEO of Microsoft, Nadella

He shared his insight about block chain, quantum computing as well as open source.

Later, I find Github, this amazing website.

I learned several open source toolkit such as vscode, keras, even bitcoin.

In Github, you can cooperate with developers all over the world.

Programming really can change the world, in my hands. 

Just like, I can be the god of my own universe.

I started to study Python, data annalyse, algorithm, machine learning, AI, deep learning, computer vision, font-end development with hunger.

That was not an easy way, I used to get stuck in a python bug or deal with data structure issue the whole day.

Without eating, sleeping, even drinking water, that's called heart-stream.

## `When you start to make content creation `

I started to write technical blogs.

At the same time, more and more people, especially students from traditional majors, such as mechanics, finance, medical research, energy engineering,  automobile, they want to get in IT world, too.

Use advanced machine learning and AI to empower their own profession.

With my experience, I believe I can really help them.

simplify the learning curve, avoid detours, and consequently save lots of time and money as well.

My first video is about convolutional neural network, the breakthough algorithm in computer vision and deep learning.

Later, I find myself good at teaching this kind of hard-core thing.

More and more subscribers make me more confident and I think this could be my career of my lifetime.

## `What cool stuff during your intern in MSRA?`

Microsoft supports Microsoft student club in hundreds of universities in China, also in my college, Tongji Univerisity.

We have the opportunity to work with Microsoft experts from MSRA on various cutting-edge projects.

Also many technical lectures, hackathon and summer camp.

Working in Microsoft is a very happy thing

I was an intern in ARD-Incubation Group, 

AI-EDU

## `MVP and MSA`

All kinds of experts and open source advocators.

Microsoft Ignite Conference

Microsoft Build Connect conference

AI bootcamp

- AI classic paper reading(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1r7411X7LC)
- Kaggle data mining(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wf4y1U7EL)
- Python basic(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1P5411W7g5)
- Raspberry Pi hardware basic(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ab411x7aC) 
- Simple tutorials of Microsoft cognitive service(https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CE411e7XR)

has gained great reputation in AI community.

# My intuition and idea

We aim to help zero basic beginners quickly master AI and big data with easy to understand and interesting vernacular, and quickly apply what they have learned

To provide a complete system of AI education solutions for students, job seekers, employees and large enterprises in the field of artificial intelligence and data analysis. Help beginners to cross the threshold of mathematics foundation, algorithm programming, frontier exploration and application landing, and quickly apply what they have learned.

From simple dormitory recording and broadcasting to professional recording studio, from fighting alone to professional post production team, from small workshop production to large factory invitation and cooperation. 

Four crucial fundations of an AI developer:

- Math(linear algebra, probability statistics)
- Coding and programming(python,scikit-learn,keras)
- Algorithm
- Real project(get your hands dirty)

railway crack detection





This process is extremely enjoyable for the team. It is determined from the bottom of my heart that we are doing a great thing and providing high-quality educational resources for a huge number of future learners. No matter from national policies, public science popularization, making money, media brands, knowledge creation, it will create huge long-term value.

## Open Source Project Wuhan 2020

Open source community and technology will thoroughly reshape the form of cooperation and knowledge production in the future, and consequently change everyone's life.

Especially in China, open source became more and more popular,  developers use Github.

Not only do they use open source developing toolkit such as visual studio code.

But also contribute their power to community. 

For instance.

At the early age of the covid-19 pandemic, middle January of 2020. Precisely the second day Wuhan this city was locked down.

My phd mentor Wang Wei and my friend Zhao Shengyu, they set up a open source project called Wuhan2020. They put their white paper and code on Github.

This project gather different information about hospital, hotel, factory, donation as well as mask and medical resource. Hundreds of volunteers took part in this project and built 23 repositories on Github.

Arrange those precious resource with high efficiency and transparent.

# Hero speech at last

The world is rapidly changing, 

Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic, 

After a year of hardship, we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

Not only the community of open-source or technology developers.

But also the community of common destiny for all mankind.
